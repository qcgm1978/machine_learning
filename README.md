α “alpha” = significance level in hypothesis test, or acceptable probability of a Type I error (probability you can live with). Defined here in Chapter 10. 1−α = confidence level.
β “beta” = in a hypothesis test, the acceptable probability of a Type II error; 1−β is called the power of the test.
μ mu, pronounced “mew” = mean of a population. Defined here in Chapter 3.
ν nu: see df, above.
ρ rho, pronounced “roe” = linear correlation coefficient of a population.
σ “sigma” = standard deviation of a population. Defined here in Chapter 3.
σx̅ “sigma-sub-x-bar”; see SEM above.
σp̂ “sigma-sub-p-hat”; see SEP above.
∑ “sigma” = summation. (This is upper-case sigma. Lower-case sigma, σ, means standard deviation of a population; see the table near the start of this page.) See ∑ Means Add ’em Up in Chapter 1.
χ² “chi-squared” = distribution for multinomial experiments and contingency tables. Defined here in Chapter 12.
